The goal of `dorem` is to provide easy-to-use dose-response models
utilized in sport science. This package is currently in active
development phases.

## Installation

You can install the development version from
[GitHub](https://github.com/mladenjovanovic/dorem) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("mladenjovanovic/dorem")

require(dorem)
```

## Example

To provide very simplistic example of `dorem`, I will use example data
provided in [supplementary
material](https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/advan.00078.2011m)
of Clarke & Skiba, 2013
[paper](https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/advan.00078.2011?),
freely available on the publisher website. Data set contains cycling
training load (i.e. dose) measured using the BikeScore metric (in AU)
over 165 days, with occasional training response measured using 5-min
Power Test (in Watts). *Banister* model (explained in aforementioned
paper) is applied to understand relationship between *training dose*
(i.e., BikeScore metric) and *training response* (i.e., 5-min Power
Test):

``` r
require(dorem)
require(tidyverse)
require(cowplot)

data("bike_score")

banister_model <- dorem(
   Test_5min_Power ~ BikeScore,
   bike_score,
   method = "banister"
)

# Get model predictions
bike_score$pred <- predict(banister_model, bike_score)$.pred

# Plot
dose <- ggplot(bike_score, aes(x = Day, y = BikeScore)) +
  theme_cowplot(10) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  xlab(NULL)

response <- ggplot(bike_score, aes(x = Day, y = pred)) +
   theme_cowplot(10) +
   geom_line() +
   geom_point(aes(y = Test_5min_Power), color = "red") +
   ylab("Test 5min Power")

cowplot::plot_grid(dose, response, ncol = 1)
```

This package is in ongoing development phase and more examples will
follow…
