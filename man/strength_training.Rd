\description{
This data set is used in Jovanovic, M. (2020) and it is generated for the purpose of demonstrating
one particular method of dose-response modeling. It represents strength training dose for N=10
athletes over 90 days. Training dose is represents with total upper- or lower- number of lifts
(\code{UBNL}, \code{LBNL}), while the training response is represented with estimated 1RM variable
(\code{est1RM}). Additional variables in this data set are \code{workout} (either Total, Lower, Upper
or Off) and \code{type} indicating training stress (easy, medium, hard).
