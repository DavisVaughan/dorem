Example data provided in \href{https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/advan.00078.2011m}{supplementary material}
of Clarke & Skiba, 2013 paper, freely available on the publisher website. Data set contains cycling training load (i.e. dose)
measured using the BikeScore metric (in AU) over 165 days, with occasional training response measured using 5-min Power Test (in Watts).
Using Banister model implemented in Microsoft Excel, Clarke & Skiba, 2013 estimate the following parameters:
\itemize{
\item Intercept of 262 W
\item Gain of Positive Training Effect of 0.18 W/AU
\item Gain of Negative Training Effect of 0.23 W/AU
\item Time Constant of Positive Training Effect of 36 days
\item Time Constant of Negative Training Effect of 21 days
\item Sums of Square Error equal to 20.25 W
\item R Squared (Variance explained) of 0.979
